# From-Scratch Implementations

Welcome to **From-Scratch**, a personal repository where I build foundational machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning concepts **from the ground up** — without relying on high-level libraries or shortcuts.

This repo is my journey into the internals of AI algorithms, implemented using raw NumPy or PyTorch, and backed by clear math, visualizations, and code explanations.

| [`Attention/`](https://github.com/Atharv-3105/From_Scratch/tree/master/Attention)     | Implementations of Vanilla, Multi-Head, and Cross Attention.
| [`Fine-Tuning/`](https://github.com/Atharv-3105/From_Scratch/tree/master/Fine-Tuning) | Fine-Tuned the OPT-125M model from Meta using LoRA.

New modules and algorithms will be added regularly.

## Goals

- Build foundational understanding by implementing key AI algorithms from scratch.
- Visualize and explain each concept for better intuition.
- Serve as a learning reference for others diving deep into ML, DL, RL, and LLMs.
